                            <br>
                            In order to join the ranks of EMS, first, you must apply for a trainee position. The applications will be found in the discordia emails, in the ems-apps section. You can find the discordia <a href="https://discord.gg/familiapurple" class="black">here</a>. Please note that Discordia is required to join, and you must have been in the city for at least one week. You must be able to solve basic questions about medical treatments and acknowledge all of the rules that a Pillbox employee must follow.

                            <strong>Interview:</strong>
                            <br>
                            Assuming your application has been accepted, the next step of the process is the interview. In order to officially become a trainee, you must be interviewed by a higher ranked medical professional and approved to be a trainee.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Training:</strong>
                            <br>
                            Once you're a trainee, you are assigned an instructor and you must be with them at all times while on duty. They will be teaching you all of the aspects of being an EMT, which is the first rank after trainee. You will learn how to respond to calls, treat patients, and many of the 10-codes that are used. You will also be quizzed at random intervals so that your instructor can track your progress.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Promotion:</strong>
                            <br>
                            Once you're instructor deems you worthy, you will be promoted to an EMT, where you will be able to answer calls by yourself, and you will typically be the first outside of the hospital. EMT/Paramedic staff are normally on patrols and are rarely inside of the hospital, whereas positions with more seniority will be in the hospital more often, mostly to perform more complex surgeries and medical treatments.
