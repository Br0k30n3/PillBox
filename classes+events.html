                            One of the key components of the Pillbox Hospital training program is clinical skills training. Trainees undergo hands-on training in various clinical settings, such as emergency medicine, surgery, internal medicine, and more.

The training is highly structured and closely supervised, with trainees receiving feedback and guidance from their mentors to continuously improve their clinical skills.
